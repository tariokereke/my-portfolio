          Emeka is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of graphic design. 
          She has a great attitude and she is an excellent team player. 
          She has a curious mind and asks the right questions. 
          She takes initiative within a team and has the potential to lead the team.

          Working with Emeka has been an awesome experience. 
          She is highly knowledgable about design and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right. 
          For any future projects that need her expertise, I would definitely want to work with her again.

          I had worked along with Emeka during the initial phase of our venture which needed a brand refresh. 
          She is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          She will be an asset for any organisation!
